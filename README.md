##### Why vuejs?
Vuejs is used for implementation of the frontend because of the following reasons below:

- Ease-of-Use: 
Vue.js embraces standard HTML-based templates which make it easier to use and revamping the existing application.
- Light-Weight: vue.js is a very light weight framework.
- Flexible: vue.js is flexible to any integration and modification
- Smoother Integration:  Whether it is a single-page application or complex web interface, Vue.js offers smoother integration 
of smaller parts without any effect on the whole system.
- Better Performance In Little Size:  It does not occupy more space and tends to give optimum performance over other frameworks.
- Well-written Documentation:  It provides an easy learning curve through the detailed documentation and requires no extra knowledge;
 HTML and JavaScript will get the job done.
- Adaptability: Overall sound design and architecture makes it a popular JavaScript framework. It provides hassle-free migration,
 simple & efficient structure, and reusable templates.
- Fastest JavaScript Framework

    `vuecli` is used to install the framework.<br>
